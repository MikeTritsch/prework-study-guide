# UT Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

Welcome to the Mike Tritsch's Prework Study Guide! This study guide was created out of a need to easily and readily access key bootcamp concepts. I built this page to practice basic coding concepts across foundational languages (HTML, CSS, and JS). This study guide solves the problem of not having a repository to practice concepts on while tracking notes. I learned about the flow and pipeline of web development through all of the stages from creation to deployment while simultaneously practicing new coding concepts.

## Usage

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the core languages covered in this study guide. Each respective section contains key notes revolving around core concepts learned in the prework period of bootcamp. The Git section contains notes about version control, command line, and important workflow order. Open the DevTools [open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)] console to see the JavaScript code in action. It will list the topics covered in Prework and will randomly choose which topic to study first.
